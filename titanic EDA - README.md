## Introduction

The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers who were aboard the Titanic when it sank in 1912. This EDA project aims to analyze the dataset to reveal key insights about the passengers, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and survival rates.

## Dataset
### In order to run my code, you will have to download the dataset for it to run appropiately.

The dataset used in this project is available from [Kaggle's Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). 
It includes various features such as:
- PassengerId
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation)
- Survived (Survival indicator)

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this EDA are:
1. To understand the distribution of passenger demographics.
2. To examine the relationships between different features and the survival rate.
3. To visualize the data to uncover patterns and correlations.
4. To generate hypotheses for further analysis or modeling.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MaherahE/codingTasks.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd titanic
   ```

## Usage

To run the analysis and view the results:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook titanic.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the notebook cells to perform the analysis and visualize the data.
